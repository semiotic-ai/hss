# HSS-Exercise
In this exercise we will be implementing a homomorphic signature scheme using cryptographic libraries from `ark-works`. This implmementation is based off the NCS1 defenition in [Signing a Linear Subspace: Signature Schemes for Network Coding](https://eprint.iacr.org/2008/316.pdf).

The protocol is defined in *HSS Exercise.pdf*.
